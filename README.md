# Tempodoro

**_Tempodoro_** (from _tempo_, meaning "time" in Italian and _pomodoro_ of course!) is a productivity companion designed to help you manage your focus and break sessions using the Pomodoro Technique.  
It offers a clean REST API for integration and can be used to start, stop, complete, and track your Pomodoro sessions, all backed by a robust authentication system.

The application is built using:

- **Java** with **Spring Boot** for the backend and REST API.
- **Spring Security** for authentication & authorization with JWT.
- **JPA / Hibernate** for database interaction.
- A relational database (H2 in this case).

The API is secured, but you can easily test it with tools like `curl` or Postman.
It is also set up with swagger, so it can be tested through that ui as well.

## Features

- **Pomodoro session management**: start, stop, complete, and delete sessions.
- **Session history filtering** by date range.
- **Customizable durations** for focus and break times.
- **Secure authentication** with JWT-based login.
- **User registration & login** endpoints.
- Relational database persistence with JPA entities.
